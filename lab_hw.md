# Lab: Water tracker

##Â Brief

You've been given a water tracker that allows a user to input their details with a name and a goal (number of glasses to drink). The user is able to update the number of glasses they have drunk and see the chart update based on this. They are also able to clear the total and reset back to 0.

## MVP

Your task is to refactor the code to utilise Context and custom hooks.
- Modify the code to use Context for user name and goal
- Extract the toggle logic into a custom hook that you can implement for the dark/light mode toggle, as well as the modal open/close toggle.

## Extension

- Add some more functionality using a new custom hook
